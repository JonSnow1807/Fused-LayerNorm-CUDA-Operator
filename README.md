Fused LayerNorm CUDA Operator for PyTorch






A counter-intuitive discovery: Making LayerNorm 1.86–2.66× faster by removing optimizations.

🎯 Key Achievement

We achieve 1.86×–2.66× speedup over PyTorch’s native LayerNorm by simplifying the implementation, not complexifying it. Our profiling shows LayerNorm is latency-bound, not bandwidth-bound, using only ~10% of GPU memory bandwidth.

📊 Performance Results

🔍 The Discovery: Simple > Complex

What We Found

Typical sizes (768–4096) use only 10.7% of memory bandwidth

We’re latency-bound, not bandwidth-bound

Complex optimizations add latency without improving throughput

Removing vectorization made it faster

Our Approach

// Instead of complex float4 vectorization...
// We use simple, clean loops:
for (int i = tid; i < N; i += blockDim.x) {
    sum += X[i];
}


Result: Less code → Fewer instructions → Lower latency → Faster execution

🚀 Key Features

✅ 1.86–2.66× faster than PyTorch’s optimized implementation

✅ Universal compatibility — any dimension (odd, prime, power-of-2)

✅ Better numerical accuracy — 4.77e-07 maximum error

✅ Fused variants — LayerNorm + GELU in a single kernel

✅ Production ready — extensively tested across edge cases

📖 Usage

Basic Usage

import torch
import fused_layernorm_cuda

# Prepare inputs
x = torch.randn(32, 4096, device='cuda')
gamma = torch.ones(4096, device='cuda')
beta = torch.zeros(4096, device='cuda')

# Run our optimized LayerNorm
output = fused_layernorm_cuda.layernorm(x, gamma, beta, eps=1e-5)

# Fused LayerNorm + GELU
output_gelu = fused_layernorm_cuda.layernorm_gelu(x, gamma, beta, eps=1e-5)


Drop-in Replacement for nn.LayerNorm

import torch.nn as nn

def replace_layernorm(module):
    for name, child in module.named_children():
        if isinstance(child, nn.LayerNorm):
            optimized = lambda x: fused_layernorm_cuda.layernorm(
                x, child.weight, child.bias, child.eps
            )
            setattr(module, name, optimized)
        else:
            replace_layernorm(child)

# Apply to any model
model = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=4096, nhead=16)
replace_layernorm(model)
# Now 1.86–2.66× faster!

📈 Why This Works

Latency vs Bandwidth Insight

Memory Bandwidth Utilization: 10.7%

Actual Bandwidth: 167 GB/s

A100 Peak: 1555 GB/s

We’re using only ~1/10th of available bandwidth, so:

Complex memory access patterns don’t help

Vectorization adds overhead without benefit

Simple sequential access is optimal

Instruction count dominates performance

Kernel Simplicity Comparison

Metric	PyTorch	Ours	Improvement
Lines of Code	~500	~100	80% less
Instruction Complexity	High	Low	Simpler
Register Pressure	High	Low	Better occupancy
Edge Case Handling	Complex	Simple	Universal

template<typename scalar_t>

        sum += X[i];
    }
    sum = blockReduceSum(sum);

    // Simple reduction for variance
    float variance_sum = 0.0f;
    for (int i = tid; i < N; i += blockDim.x) {
        float diff = X[i] - mean;
        variance_sum += diff * diff;
    }
    variance_sum = blockReduceSum(variance_sum);

🎓 Lessons Learned

Profile First — don’t assume; measure (we found 10.7% bandwidth usage)

Question Dogma — “GPUs are bandwidth-bound” isn’t universal

Simplicity Wins — less code can mean better performance

Latency Matters — optimize instruction count at low bandwidth usage
